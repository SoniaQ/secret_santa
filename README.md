User Stories

```
As a user
I would like to enter mine and other people's names
So that each person can be randomly allocated a Secret Santa

As a user
I would like an email address to be captured for each person
So that everyone anonymously receives their Secret Santa name

As a user
I would like all names and emails to be safely stored
So that each name can be randomly paired
